# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple command-line game where the computer selects a random number, and you have to guess it. You have a limited number of chances to guess the number, and the game will end either when you guess the number correctly or run out of chances.

## Features

- Select a difficulty level to determine the number of chances:
  - **Easy**: 10 chances
  - **Medium**: 5 chances
  - **Hard**: 3 chances
- Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
- Track the number of attempts and time taken to guess the number.
- Option to play multiple rounds.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the script to start the game.
2. **Select Difficulty Level**: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard to set the number of chances you have.
3. **Enter Your Guess**: Guess the number between 1 and 100.
4. **Receive Feedback**: The game will tell you if the number is higher or lower than your guess.
5. **Win or Lose**: The game ends when you either guess the correct number or run out of chances.
6. **Play Again**: Decide if you want to play another round or exit.
